# Flow for Houdini
Flow is a plugin designed to speed up the creation of nodes to be as fast as the speed of thought.

Pressing `Space` in the NetworkEditor will intercept the next key press. This next keypress will result in a binded action or macro.
For example, pressing `Space` and then `T` will run a nodeCreation event and create a Transform Node under your mouse
